# before-you-interact-
hallo hallooo!! my name is hyunjin! call me by however, i dont mind really, if u know me irl just avoid using my real name hehe, im tryna keep a gap between my irl identity and online, i hope ya can respect that! anyywayyyss, before you interact with me, make sure to read this terms!

-> DONT and i mean DONT copy or take inspos of my skins!! this is a veryy big no no! i've seen a lot of people try to copy my skins and that reallly really irritates me! Dont ever think that i wont notice because i can identify my work very easily! Dont take it as an advantage that i wont confront you. But one of my friends will! and i will NOT interact with you, if you ever decided to do so.

-> AVOID being insensitive! be mindful of whatchu say around me! i may not say anything about it but it would make me veryyy uncomfortable around you, dont bring up SA jokes, Jokes are supposed to be funny and thats clearly not... if you ever do i will NOT enjoy talking to you at all.

-> RESPECT my boundaries! people tend to have boundaries set up around them to let other people know which line not to cross! lets be mindful about these boundaries and make sure not to cross them so we dont make people uncomfortable about out actions!

-> REGARDING c+h ! c+h is ALWAYYS GOOD! dont be afraid to sit next to me! as long as you're willing to follow the terms above then youre all goods! i might even stike a convo with ya! Although i may not respond sometimes, that would mean i am offtab or afk!

THANK YOUUU! for giving me your time in reading these terms! have a nice day fellas! toodle-oooo!!
