# before-you-interact-
Hello!

My name is Hyunjin. You may call me by any name you prefer, but if you know me in real life, I kindly request that you refrain from using my real name, as I wish to maintain a distinction between my online identity and my offline one. I hope you can respect this.

Before interacting with me, please take a moment to review the following terms:

1. **Originality of Skins**: Please do not copy or draw inspiration from my skins. This is very important to me, as I have noticed instances of imitation that have been quite frustrating. I can easily identify my work, and if this occurs, I will not hesitate to involve a friend on my behalf. Consequently, I will refrain from interacting with anyone who disregards this request.

2. **Sensitivity**: It is essential to be mindful of the language used in our conversations. Certain topics, particularly those involving jokes about sensitive subjects, can be deeply uncomfortable for me. If such comments are made, I may find it difficult to enjoy our interactions.

3. **Respect for Boundaries**: Everyone has personal boundaries that help create a comfortable environment. I ask that you be respectful of these boundaries to ensure our interactions remain positive and enjoyable.

4. **Conversations and Socializing**: I welcome friendly interactions! As long as you are willing to adhere to the terms outlined above, I would be happy to engage in conversation with you. Please understand that if I do not respond immediately, I may be away from my device.

Thank you for taking the time to read these terms. Wishing you a pleasant day!

Best regards.
